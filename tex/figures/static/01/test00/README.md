This run did not go as well as the previous one. The contrast
was off by many sigma (we underpredicted it) and the mean latitude
was wrong by a similar amount (we again underpredicted it).
Interestingly, despite all that, the inclinations are again spot
on!

Also, many of the posterior map samples look pretty good, with
spots of roughly the correct size at high latitudes (albeit with
the wrong contrast).

Perhaps rather than going through the convoluted transformation
from the Beta distribution parameters to the mean and variance
of the spot size and latitude distributions, we should instead
draw posterior map samples and compute statistics based on those
images?
